Kusshi, meaning skewer in Japanese, is a method of growing oysters in floating cylindrical purses. The key advantage of this method is that the purses constantly tumble with the natural wave motion, resulting in a small but plump oyster, the desired size for a majority of chefs and customers. Since the oysters are positioned at the top of the water column where the algae is most dense, the growth rate and quality is improved compared to traditional cage growing methods. Furthermore, if the "skewer" or line that the purses are attached to is located at mean high tide, the oysters will be exposed to the air and sunlight for periods of the day, thus eradicating any parasitic sponges that weaken the oyster's shell.

Implementing this method in a cost effective manner posed a challenge for my family's farm. The majority of the costs resulted from the requirement that the infrastructure needed to be strong enough to withstand the seasonal tropical storms and occasional hurricanes that Long Island experiences.

In addition, the harsh salt-water environment posed a challenge to the type of materials that could be used. As I have learning from living on an oyster farm since I was three years old, if it is not broken, it will break soon.

The 4x4 square foot cages shown below are used in the typical method of growing oysters. The cages rest on the sea floor and are highly prone to fowling. Fully loaded, these cages can weight up to 400 pounds and require a boat with a manual or an electric winch to harvest the oysters.

The Kusshi method, however, uses purses hung on lines stretched across the water.

Inspired by the suspension bridges leading into New York City, I came up with a design that met the specified requirements. In my design, each line would be supported every 15 feet but would only need pilings every 30 feet. Not only are the pilings themselves expensive, but also the labor required to install them is costly. My design, therefore, reduced the amount of pilings needed to properly support the lines and keep them from sagging - an important requirement so that the purses do not rest on the bottom.

Since its completion in 2016, our customers including Chefs Dan Barber, Riad Nasr, Lee Hanson, and countless others have been raving about the incredible quality of our kusshied oysters. The mortality rate has decreased significantly, while reducing our workload by almost 50%. In fact, we no longer need a boat to harvest due to the positioning of the lines.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
